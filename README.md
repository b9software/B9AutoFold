# B9AutoFold

B9AutoFold is a VS Code extension that intelligently folds code blocks on file open, presenting a clear, high-level view of your code's structure. It aims to display the essential components within a single screen, enabling quicker comprehension.

It works out-of-the-box with zero configuration. Leveraging the editor's symbol information, it dynamically calculates folding ranges for any language that provides symbol data. When symbol information is unavailable, it defaults to Fold Level 2.
